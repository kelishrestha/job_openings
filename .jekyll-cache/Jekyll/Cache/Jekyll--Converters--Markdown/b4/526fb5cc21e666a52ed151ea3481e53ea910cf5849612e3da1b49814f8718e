<p>Welcome to the sample post for the Jekyll Clean theme.</p>

<p>A simple and clean Jekyll theme using <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">bootstrap</a>
(not to be confused with jekyll-bootstrap) that’s easy to modify and very
modular in component and element reuse.</p>

<p>It uses Disqus for comments and includes Google Analytics support. Both of
these features are disabled by default and can be enabled via _config.yml. You
can also rip this code out of the templates if you like (footer.html and post.html).
The beauty of Jekyll - keep things clean… Jekyll Clean!</p>

<p>The theme works well on mobile phones, using a collapsable nav bar and hiding the
sidebar. The links pane in the sidebar is available on mobile through the nav menu,
and you can do the same thing for any other sections added to the sidebar.</p>

<p>Don’t forget to occassionally merge against my upstream repository so you can get
the latest changes. Pull requests are encouraged and accepted!</p>

<h1 id="isso-comments">Isso Comments</h1>

<p>Isso requires running a local server, so is not suitable for hosting
in github pages, for example. Isso is open source and keeps all your
data local, unlike Disqus (who knows exactly what they are doing with
your data).</p>

<p>In _config.yml you’ll need to set <strong>isso</strong> to the fully-qualified URL
if your isso server (this is the value for <strong>data-isso</strong> passed to the
isso JS). Make sure <strong>comments</strong> is true.</p>

<h1 id="disqus-comments">Disqus Comments</h1>

<p>Getting Disqus to work can be a bit more work than it seems like it should be.
Make sure your Disqus account is correctly configured with the right domain
of your blog and you know your Disqus shortname.</p>

<p>In _config.yml you’ll need to set <strong>disqus</strong> to your Disqus shortname and
make sure <strong>comments</strong> is true.</p>

<p>Finally, in posts, make sure you have <strong>comments: true</strong> in the YAML front
matter.</p>

<p>More information on using Disqus with Jekyll is
<a href="https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/472138-jekyll-installation-instructions">documented here</a>.</p>

<h1 id="code-syntax-highlighting">Code Syntax Highlighting</h1>

<p>To use code syntax highlighting, use the following syntax:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>```python
import random

# Roll the die
roll = random.randint(1, 20)
print('You rolled a %d.' % roll)
``` #REMOVE
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>(Remove #REMOVE from the end of the last line). Which will look like this in
the rendered jekyll output using the default css/syntax.css provided with this
theme (which is the <strong>colorful</strong> theme from <a href="https://github.com/iwootten/jekyll-syntax">https://github.com/iwootten/jekyll-syntax</a>):</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">random</span>

<span class="c1"># Roll the die
</span><span class="n">roll</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">random</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">randint</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'You rolled a </span><span class="si">%</span><span class="s">d.'</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="n">roll</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can, of course, use any theme you wish, see the jekyll and pygments
documentation for more details.</p>
