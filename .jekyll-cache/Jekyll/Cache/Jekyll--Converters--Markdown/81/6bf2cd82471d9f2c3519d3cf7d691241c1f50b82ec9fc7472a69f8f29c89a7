<p>Welcome to the sample post for the Jekyll Clean theme.</p>

<p>A simple and clean Jekyll theme using <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">bootstrap</a>
(not to be confused with jekyll-bootstrap) that’s easy to modify and very
modular in component and element reuse.</p>

<p>It uses Disqus for comments and includes Google Analytics support. Both of
these features are disabled by default and can be enabled via _config.yml. You
can also rip this code out of the templates if you like (footer.html and post.html).
The beauty of Jekyll - keep things clean… Jekyll Clean!</p>

<p>The theme works well on mobile phones, using a collapsable nav bar and hiding the
sidebar. The links pane in the sidebar is available on mobile through the nav menu,
and you can do the same thing for any other sections added to the sidebar.</p>

<p>Don’t forget to occassionally merge against my upstream repository so you can get
the latest changes. Pull requests are encouraged and accepted!</p>
